<h2>Springs</h2>
I have had a large bag of 0.2 mm tension or extension springs for years. The smallest length of spring in the bag, 12mm, is what I've used for this project.
The exact same spring as I've used seems to be difficult to find at a reasonable price. Even though I don't need them, I thought I would try a couple of different sizes to see how they perform.
I bought some 0.4x12x4mm and some 0.3x10x3mm springs from Amazon UK.

I mounted the springs on the bolt plate/magnet plate/wire holder as they would be in the completed CAD mouse but left off the sensor plate. 
In the photo the purple/pink one on the left has the 0.4x12x4mm springs, the grey one in the middle has the 0.3x10x3mm springs and the final blue one on the right is my prototype with the 0.2x12x4mm springs.
All work but the effort needed to move them varies. The 0.4x12x4mm springs, in my opinion, requires too much force to move.
The 0.3x10x3mm springs seem to require just slightly less force to the 0.4x12x4mm spring. The shorter length meaning that the spring is stretched more and offers more resistance
The 0.2x12x4mm springs are very light to move in comparison to the other two.

The strings are stretched to about 20mm in the home position so a longer spring should work and being under less tension, it should be easier to move.
However it needs to be short enough to pull the magnet plate back to the home position when the mouse knob is released. Remember that the tension can be adjusted somewhat by moving the wire holder further up or down the M4 bolt.

Another way to reduce the tension is to install a second wire holder on the bolt for the lower springs. The picture below shows an example of this. Although in the example it is just above their original position. The wire plate could be moved further up the M4 bolt.

A search of eBay.co.uk for 0.2mm tension springs does provide listings of some suppliers of 0.2x10x3mm and 0.2x15x3mm springs. I haven't tried them but both sizes should work (in theory. I haven't tried them).

YouTube recommended a video on the IndyMower to me. https://youtu.be/UnKOp4rhu7I?si=PoE8raFwQZSphymA
In this video Nicodem Bartnik used TPU springs as part of a bumper sensor. YouTube has been recommending a lot of TPU videos to me recently so I took the hint and tried to 3D print TPU springs for the mouse.

The TPU spring is printed flat and has a custom Wire holder (now TPU holder).

This "spring" has a square cross section of 2mm across. Although it works, the tension is too much to allow the mouse to move freely. I think a 1mm cross section is likely to be better but I have not tried this yet.
