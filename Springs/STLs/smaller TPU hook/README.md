This is the set of modified model parts for the small hook version of the TPU springs.

It is just the TPU springs with the smaller fixings and the associated hooks to hold them.
The smaller hook increases the distance between the magnet plate and the hook so the spring has to be slightly longer.

I am using the TPU Spring 0.6x18mm version. If you want a tighter feel, use the 17mm version.
