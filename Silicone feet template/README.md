This directory contains the STL file for the template I used to create silicone non slip feet on the bottom of the Arduino plate on the CAD mouse as shown on the YouTube video https://youtu.be/bVAX9b2wB6A?si=D21PwzSWIdShig4m

I don't want to use the weighted base if I don't have to, so this is a way of holding the mouse in place without it. It would also be possible to use the same principles to add silicone feet to the Base as well but I haven't tried it.
