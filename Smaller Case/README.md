<p>This was not an exercise in reducing the size of the CAD mouse, but in making it easier to use.</p>
<p>I thought that moving the magnet plate closer to where the fingers hold the knob would perhaps make it easier to control without getting other unwanted movements</p>
<p>The theory is this. If you hold a broom handle horizontally in the middle, it is easy to move it vertically without it twisting. Now if you move your 
hand away from the middle of the broom handle, it will try to twist because the forces acting on it are unbalanced. The same is true with the CAD mouse. Without the case and knob, It is easier
to move and control the movement of the magnet plate by holding it directly. Adding the knob moves the placement of the fingers higher up
and the springs fight any lateral movement the fingers try to apply, applying a rotation force with the fingers as the pivot. Moving the magnet plate closer to where the fingers are placed 
should reduce this.</p>
<p>The idea was to move the magnet plate so its bottom was flush with the bottom of the knob. This doesn't affect the operation of the mechanism but maybe could make it
  easier to move the knob laterally.</p>
<p>The first step was enlarging the hole at the bottom of the knob so the magnet plate can fit and moving the mounts for the magnet plate further up the knob to a
position that aligns the bottom of the magnet plate to the bottom of the knob. This lowers the knob so the top of the case needs to be lowered 
by the same amount. Doing this breaks some of the rest of the model so other case changes need to be made to counteract this such as the
curve or the case needing made tighter and reducing the internal lip so that it doesn't interfere with the bolts.
</p>
<p>The internal mechanism remains unchanged. The only changes are to the knob and the case and the buttons (1mm longer).
I have also hollowed out the knob cap more so there is less chance it interfering with the M4 bolt, though I'm still using the original cap version.</p>
<h2> Is it worth it?</h2>
<p>Good question. I can't detect any major improvement with the movement so if you are happy with the original version, I wouldn't change it.
If you fancy a smaller version, this is only 6.25mm smaller but why not try it. It only costs the price of the filament and 4 brass heat press inserts.</p>
<h2>Update 17-March-2025 Base for smaller case</h2>
<p>I've added an STL file for a base to fit the smaller case version. Birdy67 on printables pointed out that the original design base didn't fit well with the smaller case. As I don't use the base myself, but use homemade silicone feet on the Arduino plate, I hadn't realised that the changes to the case would also affect the base.</p>
<p>Creating the base was easy as it was already part of the design and the modifications I made for the case were automatically reflected in the base so I just needed to export it. I have not printed it myself as I don't need it, so it is untested.</p>
<p>I apologise to everyone that has encountered this issue. I hope this new part fulfils you needs.</p>
