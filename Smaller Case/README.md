<p>This was not an exercise in reducing the size of the CAD mouse, but in making it easier to use.</p>
<p>I thought that moving the magnet plate closer to where the fingers hold the knob would perhaps make it easier to control without getting other unwanted movements</p>
<p>The theory is this. If you hold a broom handle horizontally in the middle, it is easy to move it vertically without it twisting. Now if you move your 
hand away from the middle of the broom handle, it will try to twist. The same is true with the CAD mouse. Without the case and knob, It is easier
to move and control the movement of the magnet plate by holding it directly. Adding the knob moves the placement of the fingers higher up
and the springs fight any lateral movement the fingers try to apply, applying a rotation force with the fingers as the pivot. Moving the magnet plate closer to where the fingers are placed 
should reduce this.</p>
<p>The idea was to move the magnet plate so its bottom was flush with the bottom of the knob. This doesn't affect the operation of the mechanism but maybe could make it
  easier to move the knob lateraly.</p>
<p>The first step was enlarging the hole at the bottom of the knob so the magnet plate can fit and moving the mounts for the magnet plate further up the knob to a
position that aligns the bottom of the magnet plate to the bottom of the knob. This lowers the knob so the top of the case needs to be lowered 
by the same amount. Doing this breaks some of the rest of the model so other case changes need to be made to counteract this such as the
curve or the case needing made tighter and reducing the internal lip so that it doesn't interfere with the bolts.
</p>
<p>The internal mechanism remains unchanged. The only changes are to the knob and the case and the buttons (1mm longer).
I have also hollowed out the knob cap more, though I'm still using the original version.</p>
<h2> Is it worth it?</h2>
<p>Good question. I can't detect any major improvement so if you are happy with the original version, I wouldn't change it.
If you fancy a smaller version, then why not try this.</p>
